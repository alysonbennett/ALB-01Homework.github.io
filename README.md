01-HTML-Git-CSS Homework
Alyson Bennett

The goal of this assignment was to refract the given HTML and CSS files to change the code without altering the appearance of the website. In doing so, the code becomes condensed and easier to follow.

I started the assignment with idenitifing duplicate classes in the CSS. I condensed multiple classes into one to remove any redundant classes. I also renamed many classes with semantic tags.  These semantic tags included header, nav, section, article, aside, and footer.

Next, I changed the div classes in the HTML to reflect the new condensed classes and semantic tags.  

From there, I changed the title to reflect the company name, and added alt descriptions to all images. Comments were inserted to explain the changes that were made. 

Last, I added spacing in the HTML for readability and changed the order of classes in CSS to reflect the flow of the HTML code. 

The updated files were pushed to GitHub to deploy.
